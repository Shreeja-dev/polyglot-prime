# IngestionAPI Overview

**IngestionAPI** is a source-agnostic data ingestion service that supports multiple transport protocols including **HTTPS**, **MLLP**, and **SOAP**. It is designed to reliably handle healthcare data payloads and integrate seamlessly with downstream AWS services.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support**  
  Accepts messages over:
  - **HTTPS (REST)**
  - **MLLP** (commonly used for HL7v2 messages)
  - **SOAP** (for legacy systems integration)

- **Automatic Acknowledgement Generation**  
  The system automatically generates and returns **well-structured acknowledgements (ACKs)** upon receiving a message:
  - **MLLP**: HL7 ACK messages
  - **SOAP**: Standards-compliant SOAP responses
  - **HTTPS**: Structured HTTP JSON responses

  These acknowledgements confirm receipt and ensure interoperability with external systems.

- **File Handling and Metadata**  
  Upon receiving any message (regardless of protocol):
  - A unique `interactionId` and a `timestamp` are generated.
  - The file is uploaded to Amazon S3 under a structured path:  
    ```
    s3://<bucket-name>/data/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<timestamp>-<interactionId>-<filename>
    ```
  - Metadata is generated and stored as a JSON file:  
    ```
    s3://<bucket-name>/metadata/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<timestamp>/<interactionId>/metadata.json
    ```

- **Structured Messaging to Amazon SQS**  
  A message is pushed to **Amazon SQS** with a deterministic `messageGroupId` to ensure **FIFO** ordering and grouping.

- **SQS Message Group ID Construction**  
  Each message sent to SQS includes a `messageGroupId` that uniquely identifies the source-destination network context. This helps maintain ordered processing within a group.

  **Message Group ID Logic:**
  ```text
  messageGroupId = <source_ip>_<destination_ip>_<port>

  #### Source IP

  The source IP is extracted from request headers, in the following order:

  - `x-forwarded-for` (primary source, typically set by reverse proxies like NGINX or load balancers)
  - Fallback to `x-real-ip` if `x-forwarded-for` is absent

  #### Destination IP and Port

  These are obtained from internal headers added by the gateway or internal networking layer:

  - `x-server-ip`
  - `x-server-port`

  This combination of client and destination IP/port forms a stable and traceable message group identity, used to construct the `messageGroupId`.

  **Note** : Accurate population of these headers by upstream infrastructure is crucial to maintain correct SQS grouping behavior.
  ```

- **Sample SQS Message**
  ```json
  {
    "messageGroupId": "202.83.55.151_10.0.24.24_443",
    "s3Response": "Uploaded to S3: data/2025/08/05/1754387067153-21991793-a608-4d19-b571-1ea96f114eea-test.zip (ETag: \"3496a7ba9fc9ce41ced802fed4bf6d46\")",
    "interactionId": "21991793-a608-4d19-b571-1ea96f114eea",
    "fileName": "test.zip",
    "fileSize": 198,
    "s3ObjectId": "data/2025/08/05/1754387067153-21991793-a608-4d19-b571-1ea96f114eea-test.zip",
    "requestUrl": "/ingest",
    "s3ObjectPath": "s3://nexus-ingestion-s3-bucket/data/2025/08/05/1754387067153-21991793-a608-4d19-b571-1ea96f114eea-test.zip",
    "tenantId": "unknown-tenant",
    "timestamp": "1754387067153"
  }
  ```

- **HTTPS Upload**
  - Accepts `multipart/form-data` with zip or data files.
  - Payloads can be tested via the following cURL:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<hostname>/ingest \
    -H "X-TechBD-Tenant-ID: <TENANT_ID>" \
    -F "file=@<PATH_TO_ZIP_FILE>;type=application/zip"
  ```

  - Health check:

  ```bash
  curl --head http://<hostname>/
  ```

- **MLLP (Minimal Lower Layer Protocol)**
  - The application listens on ports defined via the `HL7_MLLP_PORTS` environment variable:

  ```bash
  export HL7_MLLP_PORTS=2575,2576-2580
  ```

  - Apache Camel routes are dynamically created during deployment for these ports.
  - HL7 messages received via MLLP will receive an **ACK** with an **InteractionID** included in the `NTE` segment:

  ```
  MSH|^~\&|ReceivingApp|ReceivingFac|SendingApp|SendingFac|20250723103935.413+0000||ACK^A01^ACK|301|P|2.5.1
  MSA|AA|MSG00001
  NTE|1||InteractionID: 522a160f-e56e-4e9f-a412-17a63ce89da5
  ```

  - Health check for MLLP:

  ```bash
  curl http://<hostname>/actuator/health/mllp
  ```

- **SOAP Endpoints**
  - SOAP routes support **PIX** and **PNR** requests.
  - Standard SOAP acknowledgements are returned.

- **Feature Flags via Togglz**
  Togglz is used to dynamically enable or disable features at runtime.

- **üîç DEBUG_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS**
  Logs all incoming HTTP headers when enabled. Useful for debugging HTTPS/MLLP issues.

  ```yaml
  togglz:
    enabled: true
    features:
      DEBUG_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS:
        enabled: true
  ```

  Logs can be viewed in **CloudWatch** using either the `interactionId` or by searching `DEBUG_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS`.

- **üì≤ Togglz REST API Endpoints**

  | Endpoint | Description |
  |----------|-------------|
  | `GET /api/features/{featureName}` | Check status of a feature |
  | `POST /api/features/{featureName}/enable` | Enable a feature |
  | `POST /api/features/{featureName}/disable` | Disable a feature |

  **Example Usage**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<hostname>:8080/api/features/DEBUG_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS/enable
  ```
